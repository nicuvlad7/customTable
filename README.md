In the project directory, you can run:

### 'npm install'
### 'npm run build'

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

By changing the configuration in App.js you can see different table options.

data -> represents the data that will be rendered.\
rowSelect: Boolean that represents whether you want to see the checkbox for the row selection or not\
selectedRows -> the ids of the rows you have selected\
setSelectedData -> a callback that will let you select specific rows\
hiddenColumn -> you may have data from the object that you don't want to render, then you will simply add an array of those fields\
showIconOn -> if a specific cell needs an icon for example you can just add it as a configuration\
ex in this case we only have icon in the Data section for column status and only for the available ones.\
const showIconOn = {\
header: false, -> this could mean the icon is in the header section or not\
subheader: false, -> this could mean the icon is in the Subheader section or not\
data: {\
columnId: 'status',\
icon: IconElement, -> can be an svg of a font
showOn: 'available'\
}\
}\

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
